Description:

This project focuses on building a predictive analysis model using machine learning to estimate airline ticket prices based on historical flight data. The dataset includes key features such as airline, source, destination, date of journey, duration, and additional info, with the target variable being ticket price. After initial inspection and cleaning, irrelevant columns like stops, departure_time, and arrival_time were removed for simplicity. Categorical data (airline, source, destination) was converted into numerical form using label encoding, and StandardScaler was applied for feature normalization. The data was split into training and testing sets, and a Linear Regression model was implemented to learn patterns and forecast prices. Model performance was evaluated using the RÂ² score, and a Seaborn plot was used to visualize airline-wise pricing trends. The analysis revealed that airline brand and route strongly influence fares, and the model can be further improved using advanced algorithms and time-related features, offering value to customers, travel agencies, and airlines for price optimization.
